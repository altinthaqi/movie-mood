<h1 align="center">Movie Mood</h1>

<p align="center">Movie Mood is a ReactJS Web Application built on top of The Movie Database (TMDB) API.</p>
<p align="center">It serves as a web-app that serves information for any movie. With plenty of features, you can fetch the API in many ways, to find Popular Movies, Highest Rated, Lowest Rated, Search by input etc... Finding the movie you'd like to know more about, and clicking on it's image or title results in giving you proper infos for that movie in specific. There's also a Suggested section, where you can suggest movies that aren't to be found in the database, or view movies suggested by others. </p>
